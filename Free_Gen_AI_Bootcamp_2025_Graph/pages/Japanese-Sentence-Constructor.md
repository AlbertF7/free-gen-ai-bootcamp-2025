	  **Difficulty:** Level 100
	  
	  **Business** **Goal:**   
	  
	  A chat agent that acts as a teaching assistant to guide students from translating a target English sentence into Japanese. The teaching assistant is not there to provide the direct answer, only guidance.
	  
	  Will AI-Powered Assistants replace real teachers?
	  
	  **Technical Uncertainty**
	  
	  1. How well can an AI-Powered Assistant perform a very broad task?  
	  
	  2. Would a very broad task be better performed by dividing it into subtasks with specialized agents?  
	  
	  3. Does using an AI-Powered Assistant make for a good place to rapidly prototype agents?  
	  
	  4. How could we take the agent we built in an AI-Powered Assistant and reimplement it into a stack that allows for direct integration into our platform?    
	  
	  5. How much do we have to rework our prompt documents from one AI-Powered Assistant to another?  
	  
	  6. What prompting techniques can we naturally discover working in the confines of an AI-Powered Assistant?  
	  
	  7. Are there any interesting innovations unique to specific AI-Powered Assistants for our business goal?  
	  
	  8. What were we able to achieve based on our AI-Powered Assistant choice and our hardware, or budget limitations?
