<br> Here is a table with key words to help you construct the sentence:

    | Japanese | Romaji | English |
    | こんにちは | konnichiwa | Hello / Hi |
    | どこ | doko | Where |
    | 一番近い | ichiban chikai | Nearest / Closest |
    | 駅 | eki | Station |
    | ですか | desu ka | Is it...? (Question ending) |

    Sentence Structure Hint:
    "Where is ~?" → Use どこ (doko) to ask for a location.
    "Nearest station" → Use 一番近い駅 (ichiban chikai eki) to describe "the closest station."
    Politeness → Questions typically end with ですか (desu ka).

    Try forming the sentence using this structure:
    👉 "Where is the nearest station?" → [Nearest station] は [where] ですか？
    ([Ichiban chikai eki] wa [doko] desu ka?)

    Give it a try! I'll guide you if needed. 😊
